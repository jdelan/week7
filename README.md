The theme for this week is:

> Something Useful

Start by opening this folder in Atom, and then open `index.html` in Chrome.

### Agenda

1. Let's build our own version of IMDB.
2. Let's take a quiz.
3. Let's install Node and get oriented to the command line.

If we have time, we will learn about object-oriented programming:

* `npm install http-server -g`
* `http-server`
* `oop.js`

And maybe Monte Carlo simulations:
